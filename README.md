# Movie Recommender System  

This project is a **Streamlit-based movie recommendation app**.  
It suggests 5 movies similar to the one selected by the user and also displays their posters.  

- **How it works**:  
  - Uses a precomputed similarity matrix and a movie list.  
  - When a movie is selected, the app finds the top 5 most similar movies.  
  - Poster images are fetched dynamically from **The Movie Database (TMDB)** using the movie IDs.
